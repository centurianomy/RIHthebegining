 <b>Intro:</b>
  <p>
    Our project i.e. rent ink hub is to create a renting website for renting of academics items. Dont confuse the idea with the previous ideas of providing students the notes or something like that. <br>Our idea focuses on promoting and inculcate the habit of renting to ensure the reusability of the already acquired academic stuff.</br> items  rather than buying the academic items as renting would save their 80%to 85% of the original buy. <br>This would not only ensure the reusability but will be a very effective method to generate a passive income for the owner itself saving time and  toil of the seekers.</br>
    This has been a matter of concern among the students, we wont go for the buy which will be obsolete in future. rather we search for alternatives to arrange the items and one cant reach to each and every person (right people) for the needs. Actually there doesnt exist a proper system to provide them the information and our website does both the works effeciently.
    <br>
    1. Providing a database of the available items so that a seeker dont have to search anywhere else or reach people in person.</br>
    <br>2. A platform to rent those academic items for the specific time saving time and money of the indivisual.</br>
    <br>All you have to do is sit on your couch visit RIH, rent the items u need and items will be delivered to u in 2 to 3 days within the campus itself.</br>
    <br>Transforming the traditional method of arranging the items. -"Dont ask, just Rent it".</br>
    Providing a platform connecting both the seeker and the owner.
    We indian always try to find alternatives and keeping the very concern in mind we came up with this brilliant soln.
    Specially Focusing on renting of academic items as this very situations occurs each and every sem and in every clg.</p>
